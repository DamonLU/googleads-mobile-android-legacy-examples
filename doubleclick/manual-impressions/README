This sample shows how DFP ad impressions can be recorded manually when an ad
sits inside a ViewPager. The sample waits for the ad to be returned and
to be on screen to record an impression, and only records 1 impression per
request.

This sample was written and tested with Google Admob SDK v6.4.1, and
supports Android 1.6 or higher. It also requires the Android Support library.

Requirements:
- Android SDK 3.2 or higher
- Google AdMob Ads SDK for Android v6.4 or higher
- Android support library (for download directions, see
  http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html#Downloading
