Google Mobile Ads SDK for Android (Legacy)
=========================================
The Google Mobile Ads SDK is the latest generation in Google mobile advertising featuring refined ad formats and streamlined APIs for access to mobile ad networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to maximize their monetization in native mobile apps.

This repository contains the source code of samples and developer resources related to AdMob and Doubleclick For Publishers. It uses the (old) standalone SDK. Samples that use Google Play Services can be found [here](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-android).
